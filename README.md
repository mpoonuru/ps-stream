`ps-stream` is a Python utility that collects and and parses [PeopleSoft rowset-based messages](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E66686_01/pt855pbr1/eng/pt/tibr/concept_PeopleSoftRowset-BasedMessageFormat-0764fb.html) generated by sync and fullsync services into Kafka messages and topics. PeopleSoft sync processes are normally used to sync data between PeopleSoft applications. However, they can also be used as a way to generate an externalized stream of PeopleSoft objects in streaming data pipelines.

There are two major commands in `ps-stream`.

**`collect`** accepts PeopleSoft rowset-based messages over http or https, and produces a Kafka message for each transaction in the PeopleSoft message, stored in one or more Kafka topics.

**`parse`** consumes transaction messages stored by `collect` and produces Kafka messages in topics with `KTable` semantics. Each record in the resulting stream is oriented to reflect records whose record key is the primary key or identifier of the transaction message.

## Running a ps-stream container

Collect PeopleSoft sync messages.

```
$ docker run -p 8000:8000 -d ucalgary/ps-stream collect
```

## Test Drive

You can quickly deploy ps-stream on Play with Docker, a community-run Docker playground, by clicking the following button.

After starting the demo, try `POST`ing a PeopleSoft rowset-based message to the collector on port 8000, then using kafka-topics-ui on port 8001 to see the message in a Kafka topic.
